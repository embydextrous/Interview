'''
Given a initial number x and two operations which are given below: 

    Multiply number by 2.
    Subtract 1 from the number.

The task is to find out minimum number of operation required to convert number x into y using only above 
two operations. We can apply these operations any number of times.
Constraints: 
1 <= x, y <= 1000
Example:  

Input : x = 4, y = 7
Output : 2
We can transform x into y using following
two operations.
1. 4*2  = 8
2. 8-1  = 7

Input  : x = 2, y = 5
Output : 4
We can transform x into y using following
four operations.
1. 2*2  = 4
2. 4-1   = 3
3. 3*2  = 6
4. 6-1   = 5
Answer = 4
Note that other sequences of two operations 
would take more operations.

    q = deque([[x, 0]])
    while len(q) > 0:
        n, steps = q.popleft()
        if n == y:
            return steps
        q.append([n * 2, steps + 1])
        q.append([n - 1, steps + 1])

print(minOperation(2, 5))
