'''
You are given a sequence of numbers arr[0], arr[1], â€¦, arr[N - 1] and a positive integer K. 
In each operation, you may subtract K from any element of the array. You are required to find 
the minimum number of operations to make the given array decreasing.
An array arr[0], arr[1], ....., arr[N-1] is called decreasing if arr[i] >= arr[i+1] for each i: 0 <= i < N-1. 
    
    Input : N = 4, K = 5, arr[] = {1, 1, 2, 3} 
    Output : 3
