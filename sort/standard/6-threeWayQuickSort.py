'''
In simple QuickSort algorithm, we select an element as pivot, partition the array around a pivot
and recur for subarrays on the left and right of the pivot. 
Consider an array which has many redundant elements. For example, 
{1, 4, 2, 4, 2, 4, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 1, 4, 4, 4}. 
If 4 is picked as a pivot in Simple Quick Sort, we fix only one 4 and recursively 
process remaining occurrences.
The idea of 3 way Quick Sort is to process all occurrences of the pivot and is based on 
Dutch National Flag ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡± algorithm. 

In 3 Way QuickSort, an array arr[l..r] is divided in 3 parts:
a) arr[l..i] elements less than pivot.
b) arr[i+1..j-1] elements equal to pivot.
c) arr[j..r] elements greater than pivot.
