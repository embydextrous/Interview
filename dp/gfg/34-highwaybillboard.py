Consider a highway of M miles. The task is to place billboards on the highway such that revenue is maximized.
The possible sites for billboards are given by number x1 < x2 < â€¦.. < xn-1 < xn, specifying positions in 
miles measured from one end of the road. If we place a billboard at position xi, we receive a revenue of 
ri > 0. There is a restriction that no two billboards can be placed within t miles or less than it. 
Note : All possible sites from x1 to xn are in range from 0 to M as need to place billboards on a highway 
of M miles.
Examples: 
 

Input : M = 20
        x[]       = {6, 7, 12, 13, 14}
        revenue[] = {5, 6, 5,  3,  1}
        t = 5
Output: 10
By placing two billboards at 6 miles and 12
miles will produce the maximum revenue of 10.

Input : M = 15
        x[] = {6, 9, 12, 14}
        revenue[] = {5, 6, 3, 7}
        t = 2
Output : 18
