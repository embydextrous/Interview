'''
A number can always be represented as a sum of squares of other numbers. Note that 1 is a square and we can always break a number as (1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1 + â€¦). 
Given a number n, find the minimum number of squares that sum to X.

Examples : 

    Input:  n = 100
    Output: 1
    Explanation:
    100 can be written as 102. Note that 100 can also be written as 52 + 52 + 52 + 52, but this representation requires 4 squares.

    Input:  n = 6
    Output: 3
