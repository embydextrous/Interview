'''
Ugly numbers are numbers whose only prime factors are 2, 3 or 5. 
The sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, â€¦ shows the first 11 ugly numbers. By convention, 1 is included. 
Given a number n, the task is to find n'th Ugly number.

Examples:  

Input  : n = 7
Output : 8

Input  : n = 10
Output : 12

Input  : n = 15
Output : 24

Input  : n = 150
Output : 5832
