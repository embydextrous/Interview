'''
You are given n activities with their start and finish times. Select the maximum number of activities 
that can be performed by a single person, assuming that a person can only work on a single activity at a time. 

How does Greedy Choice work for Activities sorted according to finish time? 
Let the given set of activities be S = {1, 2, 3, â€¦n} and activities are sorted by finish time. 
The greedy choice is to always pick activity 1. How come activity 1 always provides one of the optimal 
solutions. We can prove it by showing that if there is another solution B with the first activity other 
than 1, then there is also a solution A of the same size with activity 1 as the first activity. 
Let the first activity selected by B be k, then there always exist A = {B - {k}} U {1}.
